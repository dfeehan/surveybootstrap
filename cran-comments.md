## R CMD CHECK results

There were no ERRORs and no WARNINGs.

There were 2 NOTES:

    Maintainer: ‘Dennis M. Feehan <feehan@berkeley.edu>’
    New submission
    
    This package was previously on CRAN, but was removed in August because I did not
    fix an ERROR in time. I have now fixed it.
    
    (on Ubuntu Linux 20.04.1 LTS, R-release, GCC, via rhub)
    
    Found the following (possibly) invalid DOIs:
      DOI: 10.1177/096228029600500305
        From: DESCRIPTION
        Status: Forbidden
        Message: 403
        
    I have checked, and this doi (which comes from DESCRIPTION) is correct
